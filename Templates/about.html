                            PoliCalc started out as an idea to bridge the gap between Traditional Media and Social Media -
                            as both medium of spreading information has some effect when it comes to the Political stand of many Filipinos.
                            As a growing nation with easy access to the internet, the Philippines continues to rely on information spread on these medium.
                            And while collecting data, analyzing, and publishing it for the public to see is an easy job for companies like Social Weather Stations and Pulse Asia,
                            Social media data is a bit trickier. Mining through hundreds - if not thousands - of raw, uncleaned data would be meaningless to a layperson.
                            For this reason, PoliCalc was created. By gathering, analyzing, and visualizing data from Social Media platforms such as Twitter,
                            it would hopefully bridge a gap and solve a problem.
                            For now, PoliCalc is here to inform the nation that the usefulness of their phones, tablets, and computers aren't just to share their
                            thoughts, opinions, and sentiments. but to learn something from it along the way.
